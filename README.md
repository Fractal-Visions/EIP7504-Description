The standard for the marketplace contract is the upgradeable, dynamic contract written in the EIP-7504 dynamic contracts pattern. This means that upgrades can be performed on the contract after it has been deployed, allowing for the addition, removal, or editing of functionality. Upgrades can only be performed by holders of the EXTENSION_ROLE, and once this role is revoked from all holders, the contract becomes non-upgradeable. The ExtensionManager API (SDK) can be used to perform upgrades to the marketplace. The MarketplaceV3 contract is the latest version of the marketplace contract and is available for deployment on all EVM chains. It has been republished with some changes, including support for Royalty Registry/Royalty Engine on select chains. More information about the MarketplaceV3 contract can be found [here](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/marketplace/marketplace-v3.md?ref=blog.thirdweb.com).
